		<h1>Welcome!</h1>

		<p>Do you wish your child could learn and grow in a nurturing environment?
		Would your child benefit from one-on-one time with a fun, safe, supportive,
		creative adult rather than going to daycare? Does your schedule interfere
		with the times offered at daycare?</p>
		
		<p>If you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, then, a private nanny
		may be your answer. Typically, a nanny will meet you where it works best. If that 
		means watching your children at home, that works! If that includes dropping your child
		off at school or activities, that works, too! A private nanny is there to help build
		a relationship with your family in order to serve you best. </p>
		
		<p>If you would like to learn more information about me, my background, schedule
		availability, continue to check out my website. I also have a page dedicated to 
		my contact info. Thank you for taking the time to view my site.</p>
		
		<p> I have also included a link to <a href="https://www.nannybutler.com/benefits-of-hiring-a-nanny">Nanny & Butler</a> that may answer any questions you
		may have about hiring a nanny and provide further information.</p>
		
		<p>Enjoy the audio clip of a child I used to care for. She is doing her best at singing
		me a lullaby.</p> <audio src="audio.file" controls></audio>
